# Data Structures (CSCI 2270): Final Project

## Project Summary

Assume that our friends decided to sell items in a small online market they created. They want a program that can track each user's account and allow the user to access their account information easily. Simple operations that the program do will be "display the items present in the list", "add an item to the list", "delete an item from the list", "count the number of items in the list", "import a new list of items", "clear the list" and "exit". The "list" is connected to the user's account and it automatically runs the program when the user uploads an item to sell or the item is sold etc.. The program should be tested and approved by our friends before it is actually implemented. Now, you and be one of our friends and test this program. Have fun and please let us know if you want to suggest some more things!
